# CowCalendar
CowCalendar is an Android application to allow farmers record key events during the reproduction cycle of a dairy cow.  The captured information is presented in a way that allows the user to quickly identify animals that need attention. If animals do not meet key dates they are highlighted to the user, preventing time lost in getting the cow pregnant again. Data is stored using the Firebase real-time database to enable multiple users access and update the application.
